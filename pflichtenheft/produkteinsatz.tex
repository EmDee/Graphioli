\section{Product usage}
The \gls{framework} serves as a \glspl{java} \gls{library} to easily implement \gls{graph} games. It provides a number of important, general functions and algorithms which allows the \gls{game-developer} to focus mainly on the game's logic.

\subsection{Scope}
The product shall be used to implement graph games on Java basis. It already contains a \gls{GUI} to display and interact with the graphs and several algorithms to relieve the coding work of potential game developer.

\subsection{Target}
The product helps graph game developer to easily develop their own graph games. While simply using the framework's general functions and \gls{GUI} they can mainly focus on their game's logic. \\
The framework mainly targets game developers who want to start immediately creating their own graph games without bothering to implement several algorithms or the \gls{GUI} beforehand.

\subsection{Operating conditions} \todo{Move this section to section 4 (product environment)}
To use the product you need to match a few criteria:
\begin{itemize}
\item A Java compatible platform
\item little storage space (less than 2MB??)
\item \gls{JVM}
\item \gls{JDK}
\item Framework library must be integrated
\end{itemize}

\section{Product usage}
The \gls{framework} serves as a \Gls{java} \gls{library} to easily implement \gls{graph} \glspl{game}. It provides a number of important, general functions and \glspl{algorithm} that allow the \gls{developer} to focus mainly on the game's logic.

\subsection{Scope}
{\graphioli} is used to implement graph games on Java basis. It already contains a \gls{GUI} to display and interact with the graphs and several algorithms to relieve the coding work of potential developers. {\graphioli} Game-Explorer can be used to manage and play the games developed with this framework.

\subsection{Target}
The product helps developers to easily develop their own graph games. While simply using the framework's general functions and GUI they can mainly focus on their game's logic. \par
The framework targets developers who want to start immediately creating their own graph games without bothering to implement several basic algorithms and functions or the GUI beforehand. \par
{\graphioli}, especially the Game-Explorer, may also be used by \glspl{player} to manage and play the games provided by this framework.

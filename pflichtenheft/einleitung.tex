\section{Introduction}
\Glspl{game} premised on \gls{graph} \glspl{algorithm} have always been played as a pastime. Mostly without the knowledge about the underlying mathematical theories, which are – of course – not always relevant for clearing \gls{level} after level. While two humans playing a graph game usually agree on the eventuation of one player winning the game, the same game on a computer must be computed to declare one \gls{player} the winner.\par

This is where \graphioli takes effect. The \Gls{java} \gls{framework} simplifies the process of developing graph-based computer games by providing an straightforward, intuitive \gls{library} that allows its user to focus the effort to the game's logical implementation. Recurring and redundant operations, algorithms and codings will be taken care of by \graphioli.\par

Products based on \graphioli will be well-structured, lightweight in terms of code size and easy to maintain.\par

\subsection{Excluded criteria}
The {\graphioli} framework does not provide a framework-oriented \gls{GUI}, that, for instance, offers the ability for the developer to ``stitch together'' games. The implemented \gls{GUI}[s] only serve as graphical output of the actual games, respectively the Game-Explorer as a visualization of a summary of available games.\par
Furthermore, it does not accept a \gls{metalanguage} for the implementation of games. The \gls{developer} has to be familiar with \Gls{java}[-based] programming and needs to acquire knowledge about the structure of the \gls{library}, as which this framework will be appropriated.\par
Using {\graphioli} one can not implement \glspl{game} that are not based on \glspl{graph}. Withal, the framework does not impinge upon the game logic, which is the developer's business. It only provides the functions specified in the \ref{REF:MANDATORY-CRITERIA} section and potentially those defined in \ref{REF:FACULTATIVE-CRITERIA}.\par
Freehand drawing of \glspl{edge} or bent edges will not be possible with the {\graphioli} framework.\par

\subsection{Excluded criteria}
The following features are excluded from the framework:

\begin{itemize}
	\item {\graphioli} framework does not provide a framework-oriented \gls{GUI}, that, for instance, offers the ability for the developer to ``stitch together'' games. The implemented \gls{GUI}[s] only serve as graphical output of the actual games, respectively the Game-Explorer as a visualization of a summary of available games.
	\item It does not accept a \gls{metalanguage} for the implementation of games. The \gls{developer} has to be familiar with \Gls{java}[-based] programming and needs to acquire knowledge about the structure of the \gls{library}, as which this framework will be appropriated.
	\item Using {\graphioli} one can not implement \glspl{game} that are not based on \glspl{graph}.
	\item The framework does not affect the game logic, which is up to the developer.
	\item Freehand drawing of \glspl{edge} or bent edges will not be possible with the {\graphioli} framework. All connections are visualized by straight lines.
	\item While it is possible to set or delete vertices, the framework does not provide drag and drop functionalities.
	\item It only provides the functions specified in Section \ref{REF:MANDATORY-CRITERIA} and potentially those defined in Section \ref{REF:FACULTATIVE-CRITERIA}.
\end{itemize}

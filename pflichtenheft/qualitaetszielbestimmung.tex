\todo{Make these a definition list.}
\todo{Maybe we can delete a few glossary entries, if they are already defined here.}
Usability - Ease of use and learning to use the framework \\

Portability - Capability of the framework to run in different environments (amount of effort it takes to make it run) \\

Maintainability - Ease with which the framework can be maintained in order to correct defects \\

Reliability - Ability of the framework to perform its functions without failure\\

Efficiency - Ratio of the complexity of a task to the effort (time, memory space) necessary to achieve it \\

Security - Level of protection against potential security breaches \\

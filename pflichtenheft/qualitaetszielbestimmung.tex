\begin{description}
	\item[Usability] Ease of use and learning to use the framework
	\item[Portability] Capability of the framework to run in different environments (amount of effort it takes to make it run)
	\item[Maintainability] Ease with which the framework can be maintained in order to correct defects
	\item[Reliability] Ability of the framework to perform its functions without failure
	\item[Efficiency] Ratio of the complexity of a task to the effort (time, memory space) necessary to achieve it
	\item[Security] Level of protection against potential security breaches

	\item[\textlabel{/E010/}{E:010}] \textbf{\textlabel{Game TwixT allows placing vertices at an invalid grid point}{E:010D}} \\
	\textbf{Details:} In the bottom right corner of the \twixt game board, an invalid vertex could be placed by a player. \\
	\textbf{Level:} \textlabel{Severe}{E:010L}

	\item[\textlabel{/E020/}{E:020}] \textbf{\textlabel{Game Graph-Coloring shows unwanted status message}{E:020D}} \\
	\textbf{Details:} In multi-player mode \graphcoloring shows message `Graph colored, press space to continue' after a graph has been fully covered. Expectation was the lack of a message since in multi-player mode a pop-up is displayed stating which player won the game. \\
	\textbf{Level:} \textlabel{Appearance}{E:020L}
	
	\item[\textlabel{/E030/}{E:030}] \textbf{\textlabel{No error message when loading invalid savegame}{E:030D}} \\
	\textbf{Details:} When the player tries to load a savegame that does not belong to the selected game, an error message 
						was supposed to be displayed in a pop-up. This did not happen. \\
	\textbf{Level:} \textlabel{Appearance}{E:030L}

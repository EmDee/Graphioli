\subsubsection{General Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item To prevent the game developer from accessing methods he is not supposed to use, the access modifier of several methods has been
changed from \texttt{public} to \texttt{default} (i.e. package private). These changes are not explicitly mentioned hereafter.
\item If the purpose of a method's \texttt{boolean} return value is not explicitly stated, it serves as an assertion that the method has
completed successfully.
